        <h4>[Verse 1]</h4>
        <p>
            See the curtains hangin' in the window</br>
            In the evening on a Friday night</br>
            A little light a-shinin' through the window</br>
            Lets me know everything's all right</br>
            </br>
            <h4>[Chorus]</h4>
            Summer breeze makes me feel fine</br>
            Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind</br>
            Summer breeze makes me feel fine</br>
            Blowin' though the jasmine in my mind</br>
            </br>
            <h4>[Verse 2]</h4>
            See the paper layin' on the sidewalk</br>
            A little music from the house next door</br>
            So I walk on up to the doorstep</br>
            Through the screen and across the floor</br>
            </br>
            <h4>[Chorus]</h4>
            Summer breeze makes me feel fine</br>
            Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind</br>
            Summer breeze makes me feel fine</br>
            Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind</br>
            </br>
            <h4>[Bridge]</h4>
            Sweet days of summer, the jasmine's in bloom</br>
            July is dressed up and playing her tune</br>
            And I come home from a hard day's work</br>
            And you're waiting there</br>
            Not a care in the world</br>
            </br>
            <h4>[Verse 3]</h4>
            See the smile awaitin' in the kitchen</br>
            Through cookin' and the plates for two</br>
            Feel the arms that reach out to hold me</br>
            In the evening when the day is through</br>
            </br>
            <h4>[Chorus]</h4>
            Summer breeze makes me feel fine</br>
            Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind</br>
            Summer breeze makes me feel fine</br>
            Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind</br>
        </p>
